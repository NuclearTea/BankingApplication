Continuation of Banking Application during my personal time after CPSC 233

This is a basic Banking Application that my partner and I started as a project for CPSC 233 (University Of Calgary)

It was quite basic but for the time that we had, it was not bad.

This version is updated with better visuals and cleaner looking interface. 
Additionly, I did an overhaul of the backend software as we did a poor job of setting it up and implementing it and because I wanted to add features that would not be possible 
unless a revision of the software was done. 

This program that was primarly made by me, is after I have 2-3 months of programming experience.

Thanks for reading!
